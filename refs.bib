abstract={The prediction of material properties based on density-functional theory has become routinely common, thanks, in part, to the steady increase in the number and robustness of available simulation packages. This plurality of codes and methods is both a boon and a burden. While providing great opportunities for cross-verification, these packages adopt different methods, algorithms, and paradigms, making it challenging to choose, master, and efficiently use them. We demonstrate how developing common interfaces for workflows that automatically compute material properties greatly simplifies interoperability and cross-verification. We introduce design rules for reusable, code-agnostic, workflow interfaces to compute well-defined material properties, which we implement for eleven quantum engines and use to compute various material properties. Each implementation encodes carefully selected simulation parameters and workflow logic, making the implementer's expertise of the quantum engine directly available to non-experts. All workflows are made available as open-source and full reproducibility of the workflows is guaranteed through the use of the AiiDA infrastructure.},

abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is now routinely used for simulating material properties. Many software packages are available, which makes it challenging to know which are the best to use for a specific calculation. Lejaeghere et al. compared the calculated values for the equation of states for 71 elemental crystals from 15 different widely used DFT codes employing 40 different potentials (see the Perspective by Skylaris). Although there were variations in the calculated values, most recent codes and methods converged toward a single value, with errors comparable to those of experiment. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad3000; see also p. 1394 A survey of recent density functional theory methods shows a convergence to more accurate property calculations. [Also see Perspective by Skylaris] The widespread popularity of density functional theory has given rise to an extensive range of dedicated codes for predicting molecular and crystalline properties. However, each code implements the formalism in a different way, raising questions about the reproducibility of such predictions. We report the results of a community-wide effort that compared 15 solid-state codes, using 40 different potentials or basis set types, to assess the quality of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof equations of state for 71 elemental crystals. We conclude that predictions from recent codes and pseudopotentials agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Older methods, however, have less precise agreement. Our benchmark provides a framework for users and developers to document the precision of new applications and methodological improvements.}}

    abstract = "{With increasing availability of good all‐electron LCAO MO (LCAO molecular orbital) wave functions for molecules, a systematic procedure for obtaining maximum insight from such data has become desirable. An analysis in quantitative form is given here in terms of breakdowns of the electronic population into partial and total ``gross atomic populations,'' or into partial and total ``net atomic populations'' together with ``overlap populations.'' ``Gross atomic populations'' distribute the electrons almost perfectly among the various AOs (atomic orbitals) of the various atoms in the molecule. From these numbers, a definite figure is obtained for the amount of promotion (e.g., from 2s to 2p) in each atom; and also for the gross charge Q on each atom if the bonds are polar. The total overlap population for any pair of atoms in a molecule is in general made up of positive and negative contributions. If the total overlap population between two atoms is positive, they are bonded; if negative, they are antibonded.Tables of gross atomic populations and overlap populations, also gross atomic charges Q, computed from SCF (self‐consistent field) LCAO‐MO data on CO and H2O, are given. The amount of s‐p promotion is found to be nearly the same for the O atom in CO and in H2O (0.14 electron in CO and 0.15e in H2O). For the C atom in CO it is 0.50e. For the N atom in N2 it is 0.26e according to calculations by Scherr. In spite of very strong polarity in the π bonds in CO, the σ and π overlap populations are very similar to those in N2. In CO the total overlap population for the π electrons is about twice that for the σ electrons. The most easily ionized electrons of CO are in an MO such that its gross atomic population is 94\\% localized on the carbon atom; these electrons account for the (weak) electron donor properties of CO. A comparison between changes of bond lengths observed on removal of an electron from one or another MO of CO and H2, and corresponding changes in computed overlap populations, shows good correlation. Several other points of interest are discussed.}",

In the last section of this paper, a number of ways of defining LCAO bond orders are reviewed, and their advantages and disadvantages discussed.If all LCAO parameters β are assumed proportional to corresponding overlap integrals S times suitable mean atomic ionization energies Ī, a simple general approximate formula for covalent resonance energies is obtained in terms of partial overlap populations and Ī's, including one or two empirical coefficients. This formula indicates that forced hybridization (see III of this series) due to inner shells should make important negative contributions to bond energies.

The validity of ``gross AO populations'' as true measures of the population in various AOs is critically discussed. It is shown that the degree of hybridization in the AOs of an LCAO MO does not in general give the true amount of s or p character in the MO; this is given instead by the gross s or p population in the MO. Nevertheless, ``forced hybridization'' among the AOs, although not contributing to gross AO populations, leads to important negative contributions to overlap populations, hence to bond energies. For example, forced 2s—2p hybridization has the result that the total overlap population for two pairs of electrons occupying bonding σ LCAO MOs built from 2s and 2pσ AOs in a homopolar diatomic molecule is actually less than the sum of the overlap populations which one would have if one pair could be in an MO built from pure 2s AOs and the other in an MO built from pure 2pσ AOs. This sort of forced hybridization with resultant loss of bond strength may explain why double bonds seldom if ever consist of two σ bonds.}",

This correspondence is discussed in terms of examples, and is traced for the N2 molecule both for the assumed case of no s–p hybridization, and for the actual case with hybridization.

A general and natural choice is to share the charge density at each point among the several atoms in proportion to their free-atom densities at the corresponding distances from the nuclei. This prescription yields well-localized bonded-atom distributions each of which closely resembles the molecular density in its vicinity. Integration of the atomic deformation densities --- bonded minus free atoms --- defines net atomic charges and multipole moments which concisely summarize the molecular charge reorganization. They permit calculation of the external electrostatic potential and of the interaction energy between molecules or between parts of the same molecule. Sample results for several molecules indicate a high transferability of net atomic charges and moments.},

abstract = {Abstract A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6 · R−6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol−1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 · R−6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    abstract = "{The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn–Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15\\%–40\\% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10\\%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.}",

abstract = {Abstract It is shown by an extensive benchmark on molecular energy data that the mathematical form of the damping function in DFT-D methods has only a minor impact on the quality of the results. For 12 different functionals, a standard “zero-damping” formula and rational damping to finite values for small interatomic distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested. The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coefficients is used. The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interatomic forces at shorter distances. With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramolecular dispersion in four representative molecular structures are found. For the noncovalently-bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermolecular distances. For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general. The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of corrected GGAs for non-covalent interactions. According to the thermodynamic benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate especially for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are observed. It seems to provide a physically correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified standard functionals. In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying density functional. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    abstract = "{An accurate determination of the electron correlation energy is an essential prerequisite for describing the structure, stability, and function in a wide variety of systems. Therefore, the development of efficient approaches for the calculation of the correlation energy (and hence the dispersion energy as well) is essential and such methods can be coupled with many density-functional approximations, local methods for the electron correlation energy, and even interatomic force fields. In this work, we build upon the previously developed many-body dispersion (MBD) framework, which is intimately linked to the random-phase approximation for the correlation energy. We separate the correlation energy into short-range contributions that are modeled by semi-local functionals and long-range contributions that are calculated by mapping the complex all-electron problem onto a set of atomic response functions coupled in the dipole approximation. We propose an effective range-separation of the coupling between the atomic response functions that extends the already broad applicability of the MBD method to non-metallic materials with highly anisotropic responses, such as layered nanostructures. Application to a variety of high-quality benchmark datasets illustrates the accuracy and applicability of the improved MBD approach, which offers the prospect of first-principles modeling of large structurally complex systems with an accurate description of the long-range correlation energy.}",

abstract = {Abstract Standard density functional theory (DFT) is augmented with a damped empirical dispersion term. The damping function is optimized on a small, well balanced set of 22 van der Waals (vdW) complexes and verified on a validation set of 58 vdW complexes. Both sets contain biologically relevant molecules such as nucleic acid bases. Results are in remarkable agreement with reference high-level wave function data based on the CCSD(T) method. The geometries obtained by full gradient optimization are in very good agreement with the best available theoretical reference. In terms of the standard deviation and average errors, results including the empirical dispersion term are clearly superior to all pure density functionals investigated—B-LYP, B3-LYP, PBE, TPSS, TPSSh, and BH-LYP—and even surpass the MP2/cc-pVTZ method. The combination of empirical dispersion with the TPSS functional performs remarkably well. The most critical part of the empirical dispersion approach is the damping function. The damping parameters should be optimized for each density functional/basis set combination separately. To keep the method simple, we optimized mainly a single factor, sR, scaling globally the vdW radii. For good results, a basis set of at least triple-ζ quality is required and diffuse functions are recommended, since the basis set superposition error seriously deteriorates the results. On average, the dispersion contribution to the interaction energy missing in the DFT functionals examined here is about 15 and 100\% for the hydrogen-bonded and stacked complexes considered, respectively. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={The definitions currently used to classify chemical bonds (in terms of bond order, covalency versus ionicity and so forth) are derived from approximate theories1--3 and are often imprecise. Here we outline a first step towards a more rigorous means of classification based on topological analysis of local quantum-mechanical functions related to the Pauli exclusion principle. The local maxima of these functions define 'localization attractors', of which there are only three basic types: bonding, non-bonding and core. Bonding attractors lie between the core attractors (which themselves surround the atomic nuclei) and characterize the shared-electron interactions. The number of bond attractors is related to the bond multiplicity. The spatial organization of localization attractors provides a basis for a well-defined classification of bonds, allowing an absolute characterization of covalency versus ionicity to be obtained from observable properties such as electron densities.},
