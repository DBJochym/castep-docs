abstract={The prediction of material properties based on density-functional theory has become routinely common, thanks, in part, to the steady increase in the number and robustness of available simulation packages. This plurality of codes and methods is both a boon and a burden. While providing great opportunities for cross-verification, these packages adopt different methods, algorithms, and paradigms, making it challenging to choose, master, and efficiently use them. We demonstrate how developing common interfaces for workflows that automatically compute material properties greatly simplifies interoperability and cross-verification. We introduce design rules for reusable, code-agnostic, workflow interfaces to compute well-defined material properties, which we implement for eleven quantum engines and use to compute various material properties. Each implementation encodes carefully selected simulation parameters and workflow logic, making the implementer's expertise of the quantum engine directly available to non-experts. All workflows are made available as open-source and full reproducibility of the workflows is guaranteed through the use of the AiiDA infrastructure.},

abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is now routinely used for simulating material properties. Many software packages are available, which makes it challenging to know which are the best to use for a specific calculation. Lejaeghere et al. compared the calculated values for the equation of states for 71 elemental crystals from 15 different widely used DFT codes employing 40 different potentials (see the Perspective by Skylaris). Although there were variations in the calculated values, most recent codes and methods converged toward a single value, with errors comparable to those of experiment. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad3000; see also p. 1394 A survey of recent density functional theory methods shows a convergence to more accurate property calculations. [Also see Perspective by Skylaris] The widespread popularity of density functional theory has given rise to an extensive range of dedicated codes for predicting molecular and crystalline properties. However, each code implements the formalism in a different way, raising questions about the reproducibility of such predictions. We report the results of a community-wide effort that compared 15 solid-state codes, using 40 different potentials or basis set types, to assess the quality of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof equations of state for 71 elemental crystals. We conclude that predictions from recent codes and pseudopotentials agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Older methods, however, have less precise agreement. Our benchmark provides a framework for users and developers to document the precision of new applications and methodological improvements.}}

    abstract = "{With increasing availability of good all‐electron LCAO MO (LCAO molecular orbital) wave functions for molecules, a systematic procedure for obtaining maximum insight from such data has become desirable. An analysis in quantitative form is given here in terms of breakdowns of the electronic population into partial and total ``gross atomic populations,'' or into partial and total ``net atomic populations'' together with ``overlap populations.'' ``Gross atomic populations'' distribute the electrons almost perfectly among the various AOs (atomic orbitals) of the various atoms in the molecule. From these numbers, a definite figure is obtained for the amount of promotion (e.g., from 2s to 2p) in each atom; and also for the gross charge Q on each atom if the bonds are polar. The total overlap population for any pair of atoms in a molecule is in general made up of positive and negative contributions. If the total overlap population between two atoms is positive, they are bonded; if negative, they are antibonded.Tables of gross atomic populations and overlap populations, also gross atomic charges Q, computed from SCF (self‐consistent field) LCAO‐MO data on CO and H2O, are given. The amount of s‐p promotion is found to be nearly the same for the O atom in CO and in H2O (0.14 electron in CO and 0.15e in H2O). For the C atom in CO it is 0.50e. For the N atom in N2 it is 0.26e according to calculations by Scherr. In spite of very strong polarity in the π bonds in CO, the σ and π overlap populations are very similar to those in N2. In CO the total overlap population for the π electrons is about twice that for the σ electrons. The most easily ionized electrons of CO are in an MO such that its gross atomic population is 94\\% localized on the carbon atom; these electrons account for the (weak) electron donor properties of CO. A comparison between changes of bond lengths observed on removal of an electron from one or another MO of CO and H2, and corresponding changes in computed overlap populations, shows good correlation. Several other points of interest are discussed.}",

    abstract = "{LCAO molecular orbital overlap populations give in general much more flexible and widely useful measures of the non‐Coulombic parts of covalent bond energies than do LCAO bond orders. They are immediately applicable to both π and σ bonds, including bonds involving hybrid AOs of all kinds, and they take account directly of the effects of variations in bond length on bond strength. In the last section of this paper, a number of ways of defining LCAO bond orders are reviewed, and their advantages and disadvantages discussed.If all LCAO parameters β are assumed proportional to corresponding overlap integrals S times suitable mean atomic ionization energies Ī, a simple general approximate formula for covalent resonance energies is obtained in terms of partial overlap populations and Ī's, including one or two empirical coefficients. This formula indicates that forced hybridization (see III of this series) due to inner shells should make important negative contributions to bond energies. The application of the formula to H2, CO, and H2O is discussed.The assumption of proportionality of β values to SĪ values may be useful also in estimating unknown β values.}",

    abstract = "{The effects of AO hybridization on gross AO and overlap populations for LCAO‐MO electron configurations are discussed in terms of some simple examples, using equations and graphs. The validity of ``gross AO populations'' as true measures of the population in various AOs is critically discussed. It is shown that the degree of hybridization in the AOs of an LCAO MO does not in general give the true amount of s or p character in the MO; this is given instead by the gross s or p population in the MO. Nevertheless, ``forced hybridization'' among the AOs, although not contributing to gross AO populations, leads to important negative contributions to overlap populations, hence to bond energies. For example, forced 2s—2p hybridization has the result that the total overlap population for two pairs of electrons occupying bonding σ LCAO MOs built from 2s and 2pσ AOs in a homopolar diatomic molecule is actually less than the sum of the overlap populations which one would have if one pair could be in an MO built from pure 2s AOs and the other in an MO built from pure 2pσ AOs. This sort of forced hybridization with resultant loss of bond strength may explain why double bonds seldom if ever consist of two σ bonds.}",

This correspondence is discussed in terms of examples, and is traced for the N2 molecule both for the assumed case of no s–p hybridization, and for the actual case with hybridization. It is pointed out that repulsions between nonbonded atoms in VB theory (including those which give rise to steric hindrance) have their counterpart in negative overlap populations between the same atoms in LCAO theory. The π overlap populations for the various links in 1,3‐butadiene are computed by LCAO theory. It is shown how they are affected by conjugation (see Table I) and the results are compared with those of VB theory.}",

abstract={For quantitative description of a molecular charge distribution it is convenient to dissect the molecule into well-defined atomic fragments. A general and natural choice is to share the charge density at each point among the several atoms in proportion to their free-atom densities at the corresponding distances from the nuclei. This prescription yields well-localized bonded-atom distributions each of which closely resembles the molecular density in its vicinity. Integration of the atomic deformation densities --- bonded minus free atoms --- defines net atomic charges and multipole moments which concisely summarize the molecular charge reorganization. They permit calculation of the external electrostatic potential and of the interaction energy between molecules or between parts of the same molecule. Sample results for several molecules indicate a high transferability of net atomic charges and moments.},
