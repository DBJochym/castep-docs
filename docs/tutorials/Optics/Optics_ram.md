# Optics

Optados is capable of getting numerous optical properties of different structures, all of which depend on the wavelength (energy) of light interacting with it. In this tutorial, we will perform an Optados optics calculation on rutile (TiO~2~) - a birefringent crystal with anisotropic optical properties, examining its single-crystal and polycrystalline (isotropic) properties.
