We now look at some more realistic examples. These are fairly large crystals - to get them
to complete in a short time we will run them on a cluster.
**Use the following number of
cpus:**

**analine - 4 cristoballite - 6 quartz - 13**

(these numbers are chosen to give efficient k-point scaling)

<b>Oxygen-17 NMR</b>
<br>
Oxygen is a component of many geological materials. Oxygen is
also important element in organic and biological molecules since it is often intimately involved in hydrogen bonding. Solid State ^17^O NMR should be a uniquely valuable probe as the chemical shift range of ^17^O covers almost 1000 ppm in organic molecules. Furthermore ^17^O has spin I = 5/2 and hence a net quadrupole moment. As a consequence of this the solid state NMR spectrum is strongly affected by the electric
field gradient at the nucleus.

Because the isotopic abundance of ^17^O is very low (0.037%) and the NMR linewidths due to the electric field gradient relatively large, only limited Solid State NMR data is
available. This is particularly true for organic materials. First principles calculations of ^17^O NMR parameters have played a vital role in assigning experimental spectra, and developing empirical rules between NMR  parameters and local atomic structure.</i>
