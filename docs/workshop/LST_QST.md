# Transition State Search Tutorial
## Example: LST/QST

  Linear Synchronous Transit/ Quadratic Synchronous Transit (commonly known as `LST/QST`) is a quick and reasonably accurate method to find a transition state. 

  In this example, you will wrok through successfully determining the transition barrier for a simple (and somewhat uninteresting) reaction, `H + H2 -> H2 + H`

  ### Geometry Optimisation

  Good transition state searches are based upon good structural relaxations of the initial and final states.
